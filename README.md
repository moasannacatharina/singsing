## About

A school assignment collaboration between students from Web Developer and IP Graphical Production and Form at Yrgo.
Our mission is to create an event invitation in digital and physical form for a company or organisation of our choosing. The event can be fictitious or recurring.
My job has been to create a static landing page in HTML, CSS and Javascript based on wireframes and designs given to me by a student from IP.
<br><br>
We've chosen to create an invitation for the karaoke bar Singsing in Gothenburg. The event is the launch of their new karaoke bar. Which isn't real, by the way. It's very fake.

- A unique landing page that follows the graphic manner of the chosen company.

- The landing page needs to contain at least five animations, one of which must be an in-animation when the page is first displayed.
- It should have a CTA where visitors can sign up to the event through a form, the form only needs to be visual.
- The site should be personalized with a link that can be sent out with query parameters (https://davidwalsh.name/query-string-javascript). The site should contain at least two different personalizations.
- The site should be built statically using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- The landning page has to be pushed to a public repository on Github.
- It should also be hosted on a hosting service such as Netlify, Vercel or GitHub Pages.
- The landing page should be optimized and have as high a score as possible on https://web.dev/ by using a bundler such as Parcel.

## Code Review

- `Events.js` I suggest you put all query selectors at the top of the document.
- `Index.html:198` I would suggest that you add aria-label for accessibility.
- Great structure of files, made it easy to find everything.
- Amazing work! Easy to read your code and overall everything is great!
