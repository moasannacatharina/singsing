## About 
<br>
A school assignment collaboration between students from Web Developer and IP Graphical Production and Form at Yrgo. 
Our mission is to create an event invitation in digital and physical form for a company or organisation of our choosing. The event can be fictitious or recurring. 
My job has been to create a static landing page in HTML, CSS and Javascript based on wireframes and designs given to me by a student from IP. 
<br>
We've chosen to create an invitation for the karaoke bar Singsing in Gothenburg. The event is the launch of their new karaoke bar. Which isn't real, by the way. It's very fake.
